# wxMathPlot

I have updated the mathplot component for wxWidgets 3.2.1.
I have made some improvements like :
- corrected some bugs (and probably add others lol )
- rewrote some methods
- added a config window (that you can have access with the right click)
- lot of things ...
I keep the philosophy and the structure so it was easy to update existing project (I hope !).
